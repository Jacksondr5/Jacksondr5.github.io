title: "Building a Network"
---

Over the past few months I've been upgrading my home network from your typical home setup into something that's slightly more robust and extendable. Throughout the process, I've learned a lot more about networking

## Installing Hardware

I was very fortunate in that my apartment came "wired" with cat 5e ethernet cables in the walls, so I was able to use that as the backbone of my network. Now, when I saw "wired", what I mean is that the builders just stuffed some wires in the wall and then someone came in and hacked them all up to set up a landline phone

_Figuring out where all these wires went took a while. Still not sure where one of them goes...._

Many of the other ethernet jacks around the house were either wired for a landline or just completely hacked up. But, that's nothing a few hours of work can't fix. After connecting all the wires to proper terminals, I was able to install my network equiptment. In the picture below, you can see the cabel line going into my modem (black box on the left), which connects to my router (middle white box), which is connected to a power over ethernet (PoE) switch that powers many of the other network devices around the apartment. That hole in the wall above is now the outlet with all the ethernet cables going into it. I'll clean up the cables someday....

_I happened to be setting up my network right after buying my first impact drill. So, naturally, everything that could be attached to the wall was attached to the wall._

## DNS

Like most technology professionals, I have a love/hate relationship with DNS

#### Setting Up a React App

_Be sure you've [set up Node and Yarn](https://jacksondr5.github.io/nodeYarn) first!_

_If you just want to play around with a particular library, check out the [Playgrounds](https://jacksondr5.github.io/playgrounds) page first._

In order to set up a React app, I recommend using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a tool created by Facebook that does a ton of configuring for you, letting you use really useful tools quickly and painlessly. `create-react-app` gives us hot module replacement during development, a JS linter to help spot errors in code, a preconfigured Jest setup, and scripts to build our app into static HTML, JS, and CSS files for deployment.

In order to use `create-react-app` open up cmd/PowerShell and type

`npx create-react-app [directoryYouWantYourAppIn]`

`npx` is a utility that ships with `npm`. It checks the npm repo for the latest version of the script before running it. `create-react-app` will build a project folder for you, setting you up to start coding.

Read more [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) about what to do afterwards to set up your own project.

#### Playgrounds

In an effort to get more people to adopt their software, many developers have started hosting online playgrounds where you can try out stuff for yourself in the cloud. I was able to find some of these and put them below.

## [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

CodeSandbox is a nice place to go and try stuff out, but it does require familiarity with working in React, so I'm putting it here for future reference. If you want to try out plain React, they have a preset for that.

## material-ui

Many of the component demos on the [material-ui website](https://material-ui-next.com/) give you the ability to launch the demo in a CodeSandbox. Just click the pencil on top of the demo.

## [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Examples.html)

There are several examples of Redux [here](). You can open up the sandboxes for nearly all of them and play around. I recommend [this one](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos) as a starter. There are some tests in there that you can ignore for now (stuff with .spec.js in the file name).

## [GraphQL](https://launchpad.graphql.com)

Apollo has provided a playground for their implemnetation of GraphQL. You should be able to play around in it and use the same tools that I'm using to build the real server. Here are several pre-made playgrounds that I think could be helpful:

[Posts and Authors:](https://launchpad.graphql.com/1jzxrj179) This playground is a very simple example, but can help piece together some of the concepts.

[Star Wars API:](https://launchpad.graphql.com/mpjk0plp9) This playground uses the star wars API that is used in the [Introduction to GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn) documentation.

## Jest

[Here](https://repl.it/repls/SadDopeyVervet) is a simple playground that you can use to play around with Jest. Write code in add.js and tests in add-test.js.
